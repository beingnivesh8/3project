Airbnb-Analysis


ESSENTIAL LIBRARIES:
import os, import json, import git, import pandas as pd, import plotly.express as px, import streamlit as st, from streamlit_option_menu import option_menu, import time, import mysql.connector and
from sqlalchemy import create_engine.

DATA SOURCE:
The data utilized in this project predominantly consists of openly available datasets sourced from PhonePe - https://github.com/PhonePe/pulse

WORK FLOW:
The step by step procedures are shown below;

STEP 1 : Data extraction involved retrieving information from the 2019 Airbnb dataset, comprising property listings with details such as descriptions, pricing, location, and reviews.

STEP 2 : Utilizing Python, the Airbnb dataset from 2019 underwent transformation and preprocessing, resulting in structured DataFrames. This process involved cleaning, organizing, and 
         preparing the data for analysis, ensuring its quality and usability for insights extraction

STEP 3 : Mysql connector used for connection between Python and MySQL database with XAMPP, enabling data transfer. SQLAlchemy's engine facilitates efficient querying, simplifying 
         database interactions for Python

STEP 4 : With the assistance of Streamlit and Plotly, a dashboard and charts are created, offering geospatial visualizations and top insights. This setup empowers users to explore and 
         reveal trends within the dataset, facilitating insightful analysis.

LESSONS LEARNED:
Python scripting, Data Preprocessing, Visualization, EDA, Streamlit and PowerBI.
